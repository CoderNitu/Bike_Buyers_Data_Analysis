## METHODOLOGY

## 1. DATA COLLECTION :

     Collected a biker demographic dataset and imported it into MS Excel using Power Query for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). We can find the Excel file in my project repo 
     as an "Excel Project file"
   
## 2.  DATA CLEANING :

    Check the different columns and rows of the dataset to see whether there are some inconsistent data or anomalies (outliers, missing values) and redundant (duplicate) values. If there 
    is, replace and remove them to have more accurate and efficient results after analysis.
    
## 3.  DATA PROCESSING :

     After data cleaning, we will process or transform the data according to the data analysis requirements (which will help to analyze the data later on).
    
## 4. DATA ANALYSIS :

     We will analyze the dataset that we have by solving all the key sample questions. I will provide the questions to my project repo as "Key Questions"
   
## 5. PRESENT THE DATA :

    This is the last step where we will present a report to the client by creating a visually appealing dashboard, in our case we present a bike sales report after analyzing the 
    dataset with the help of a pivot table & pivot chart. We will also provide some crucial insights, which will help client to understand their  customers and 
    increase their sales to enhance their business.
